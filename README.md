### Cyanobacteria Population Analysis

## Jasper Clement, Anne Barto, Greg Billiel  

## Background  

&emsp; Metabarcoding is a DNA-based technique that can be used to measure aquatic biodiversity. This helps to keep track of the growth of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria growth needs to be monitored since many taxa can produce toxins that have major negative effects on the ecosystems they inhabit (MacKeigan et al 2022). These cyanobacteria toxins may also result in neurological diseases through exposure (Sini et al 2021). The lakes that were sampled were Lake Winnipesaukee and Lake Tahoe (air vapor and water samples). The samples and data were provided by MassDEP with many environmental variables. Using the obtained data, we analyzed the relevant characteristics and the phylogenetic properties.

## Methods

&emsp; The fastgz file data seen below was trimmed, aligned, and classified before being compiled into the PCA plots. QIIME and conda genomics were both used in Visual Studio Code to run the QIIME and fastq commands. The parameters for the QIIME commands were provided to us beforehand (seen in qiime2_parameters.sh). Before officially starting, the necessary directories were created in order to store the data (seen in inti-repo.sh). The conda genomics environment was then activated, and output directories were formed using polyG filters (seen in polyGfilter.sh). The filter ran and removed the polyG tails as well as reads that were too short once trimmed. Empty files were also removed (seen in 01_trim.sh). Once the reads and files that needed to be removed were gone, the fastqs were imported to QIIME, and demultiplexed sequences were added to the results directory in order to create a .qza file to be used for cutadapt and QIIME2 downstream analyses. Cutadapt was used with QIIME before QIIME summarized the data into a standardized format (seen in 02_cutadapt.sh). This isolated the amplicons to be analyzed into the proper file, and the dada2 denoising program was used to help with sequencing errors through correction, dereplication, and chimeric sequence removal (seen in 03_denoise.sh). The data was then classified using the classifier feature of QIIME based on a reference database and metadata (seen in 04_classify.sh). Lastly, QIIME was used to create a barcode plot of the taxonomic composition of each sample. The plots were made using the QIIME2 feature table and the taxonomy files. QIIME was also used to make a phylogenetic tree that ran core metrics in order to get both the alpha and beta diversity for each sample. This was then used in the next sample to create a PCoA plot of the beta diversity metrics (seen in 05_barcode_plot.sh). Once analyzed, the metrics were used to make Weighted and Unweighted Unifrac Emperor plots, a Bray-Curtis Emperor plot, and a Jaccard Emperor plot, although only the weighted Unifrac plot was analyzed, as it provided both abundance and phylogeny considerations. The taxonomic bar plot and the PCoA plot are both analyzed below to help understand this project further.

**Figure Three** Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of weighted Unique Fraction Metric (UniFrac) distances among cyanobacterial communities visualized in QIIME 2 Emperor. Axes 1, 2, and 3 explain 32.97%, 21.36%, and 12.43% of total variation, respectively. Sample shapes denote groupings (squares are numbered samples, spheres are AIR samples, diamonds are NTC and PAC samples, cones are WLW samples, and cylinders are XB samples).

## Discussion - 

**Figure One Analysis:**

&emsp; The frequency histograms of sequencing depth for both forward and reverse reads demonstrate a largely similar distribution across the sample cohort, indicating an accurate sequencing effort with limited variability. In both directions, the majority of samples fall within the 0–600k sequence range, with the modal bin occurring between 200k and 400k sequences, wherein six samples are represented. A secondary cluster of five samples occupies the 0–200k bin, while four samples each are distributed across the 400k–600k and 600k–800k ranges, suggesting a moderate spread of mid-depth libraries. Notably, a small subset of two samples in both the forward and reverse reads exhibits substantially higher sequencing depths, these falling within the 1.2M-1.4M bin, indicating potential outliers that may reflect unequal library preparation or read reservoir imbalances. The near-identical distributions observed between forward and reverse read histograms suggest strong pairing fidelity and technical accuracy in the sequencing run, with no directional loss or asymmetric difference in reads. This uniformity between directions is indicative of quality reads, as divergence between forward and reverse depth distributions can signal adapter trimming issues or orientation-specific sequencing failures. The presence of high-depth outlier samples warrants consideration during downstream analyses, as disproportionately deep libraries may introduce bias in diversity metrics if rarefaction thresholds are not carefully calibrated to account for the full range of observed sequencing depths.

**Figure Two Analysis -** 

&emsp; Taxonomic composition analysis of the cyanobacterial samples, as visualized in the QIIME 2 taxa barplot, revealed an overwhelming dominance of the domain Bacteria across all samples, with relative abundances approaching 99–100% in every case. In contrast, Archaea were either entirely absent or negligibly present, contributing minimally to the overall microbial community structure. This uniformity across all sample types indicates a highly conserved domain-level composition despite the substantial phylogenetic and compositional differences observed in the later PCoA analysis. Notably, even samples that were strongly separated along Axis 1 in the weighted UniFrac PCoA (Figure Three) did not exhibit divergence at the domain level, suggesting that the observed community differences are not driven by broad taxonomic shifts (e.g., Bacteria vs. Archaea), but rather by variation within bacterial lineages.

**Figure Three Analysis -** 

&emsp; Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the weighted UniFrac distance matrix revealed several distinct characteristics regarding the cyanobacterial community structure across samples, as visualized through the Emperor interface in QIIME 2. The first three axes explained 32.97%, 21.36%, and 12.43% of the total variation, respectively, indicating that a substantial proportion of community dissimilarity is captured within the ordination space. The most prominent feature of the plot was the strong phylogenetically-informed separation along Axis 1, which represents the largest source of variation in the dataset. Along this axis, a tightly clustered group of square-labeled, numbered samples was clearly isolated on the positive end, while all other sample types, including spherical (AIR), diamond (NTC and PAC), conical (WLW), and cylindrical (XB) samples, were distributed along the negative side. This pattern demonstrates significant phylogenetic structuring and suggests that the square samples share a highly similar and potentially environmentally constrained community composition. Their tight clustering further indicates high intra-group relatedness, consistent with a shared ecological niche or selective pressure that favors a stable and conserved cyanobacterial assemblage. In contrast, the broader dispersion of the non-square samples reflects greater heterogeneity, implying that these communities are shaped by more variable and/or less restrictive environmental conditions.

&emsp; Further examination of the ordination reveals additional gradients of variation beyond the primary Axis 1 separation. Axis 2, which accounts for 21.36% of the variation, distinguishes substructure within the non-square samples, suggesting the presence of secondary environmental or ecological drivers influencing community composition. Notably, diamond (NTC and PAC) and spherical (AIR) samples tend to occupy higher positions along this axis, whereas conical (WLW) samples and the cylindrical (XB) sample are distributed more centrally to lower along Axis 2. This separation indicates that, while these samples may share some phylogenetic overlap, they are still differentiated by smaller-scale compositional shifts, potentially reflecting differences in environmental inputs or localized habitat conditions. Additionally, the absence of a smooth gradient across sample groupings suggests that these differences are not driven by a single continuous variable but rather by multiple interacting factors. Axis 3 (12.43%) contributes further, though more modest, separation, primarily isolating a small number of outlying samples positioned at the extremes of the ordination space. These outliers likely represent unique or transitional community states that deviate from the dominant assemblages. Collectively, these results indicate that cyanobacterial communities are structured along a major compositional gradient that strongly separates the square samples from all others, while additional axes capture more nuanced variation within the remaining groups, consistent with complex and potentially overlapping environmental influences driving community assembly.
